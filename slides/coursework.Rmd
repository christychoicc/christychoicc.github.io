# Outline
I have completed a diverse range of spatial and urban planning coursework during my bachelors and masters studies, this includes Wilmslow Baseline Analysis Report; Trafford Local Plan-Making - Transport, Development Management; Planning Application for Residential Development at Thornham Old Road, Oldham – Site Potential Evaluation and Design and Access Statement; Site Analysis and Local Character and Facilities with Map Making Illustrations; M3 1FB Context Analyses and Sustainable Development Final Project; M1 4HD Office Valuation Report, Housing Market Insights Report of Greater Manchester; Woodford Aerodrome, Stockport Public Local Planning Enquiry 

For this presentation I will focus specifically on my work related to transportation and mobility. 
- Spatial Analysis 
- Mobility vs Personality
- Transport Analysis and Policy Proposal

# TfL Vision Zero Action Plan

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Background]
.small[
**Background and Policy Overview**
- **Goal**: Eliminate all deaths and serious injuries on London’s transport network by 2041.

- **Ambitions**: Focuses on safe speeds, safe streets, safe vehicles, and safe behavior.

- **Trends**: Fatality rates increased by 16% compared to 2023, with only a minor reduction in overall serious injuries.

- **Vulnerable Road Users**: Pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists account for 80% of all fatalities.

- **Spatial Strategy**: Identifying high-risk hotspots is essential for targeted prevention and effective policy intervention.
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[Data]
.small[
**Which areas exhibit spatial hotspots clustering activity of deaths and serious injuries across London in 2024?** 

Hypothesis: Incidents causing deaths and injuries are not spatially random, and they do exhibit clustering in specific areas of London.
.pull-left-narrow[
Data: 
- London Boundaries Data (Polygon)
- London MSOA (Polygon)
- TfL Casualty Data (Point)]
.pull-right-wide[
Data Processing
- Spatial: Reproject CRS (EPSG:27700), subset MSOA boundaries to Greater London
- Filtering: Limit data to 2024 and filter "Fatal" and "Serious" data only
- Joins: Count casualties by MSOA and calculate density for hotspot analysis

.panel[.panel-name[Reflection]
### Limitations & Future Research
* **Temporal Scope**: Analysis is limited to 2024; longer time frame is required to capture long-term trends and patterns
* **Interpretation Warning**: Hotspots identify clustering of incidents, but they should not be viewed as the only "hazardous" areas for transport
* **Behavioral Factors**: High incident rates in Central London may be linked to urban stress; future research should incorporate **Big Five personality**
* **Land Factors**: Next steps include analyzing hotspots alongside **land use data** (commercial, residential, industrial) for holistic policy intervention.

# Proposal
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Active Travel]
- Improve pedestrian and cycling paths to encourage alternatives for short-distance travel
- "two-pronged" approach 
  - Promotes public health (physical and psychological) benefits while reducing car reliance
  - Improve environmental conditions
- Safety measures required (e.g. additional signs and potentially traffic directions to make sure users are within a safe margin)
]

.panel[.panel-name[Car Club]
- Establish short-term car rental services to reduce private car ownership and parking pressure
- A cost-effective "pay as you drive" model, that supports net-zero goals, improves air quality, and serves irregular household travel needs
- CoMoUK2021’s car club report: 27% of the respondents indicated that the reason for joining the car club membership is money saving and 75% of them agreed the fact that joining a car club membership can save money than owning a car
]

.panel[.panel-name[Public Transport Incentives]
- Introduce a monthly travel card subscription offering discounted fares and travel rewards (e.g. cash rebates)
- Increased demand can incentivise transport companies to improve bus frequencies, making public transport a more attractive and reliable commuting option
