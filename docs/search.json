The analysis applied point pattern analysis methods and spatial autocorrelation methods to identify statistically significant hotspot and coldspot areas and discuss policy implications for Vision Zero.\nView the full report (HTML): TfL Vision Zero\nNew York Evictions\nThis is a spatial hotspot analysis examining where eviction activities cluster across New York in 2020 using evictions data provided by NYC Open Data. The analysis applied point pattern analysis methods and spatial autocorrelation methods to identify statistically significant hotspot and coldspot areas, discussing areas to be prioritiesed for policy interventions.\nView the full report (HTML): New York Evictions\nGraffiti San Francisco\nView the full report (HTML): coming soon…\nCASA0007 Quantitative Methods\nHouse Prices and London Underground: Does Multiple Interchange Tube Stations Link with Higher London House Prices in 2024?\nDo multi-line Tube interchanges relate to higher house prices in London? This report analysed 82k+ property sales in London in 2024 from HM Land Registry Price Paid Data to test whether the connectivity level of the nearest Underground station (single-line vs 2-line vs 3+ line interchange) is associated with sale prices, controlling for property types, distance to central London, distance to nearest Tube station, and deprivation indicies (IMD). The final model explained a substantial variance (R² ≈ 0.527) and found higher prices near multi-line interchanges. Some local neighbourhood effects remain visible in the unexplained part of the model, supported by a positive Moran’s I (≈0.389). A technical appendix is included within the report.\nView the full report (PDF): [London House Prices and Underground Regression Analysis 2024] coming soon…\nCASA0023 Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments\nView my Learning Diary (Webpage): CASA0023 Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments 25/26 Learning Diary\nNote: This webpage is still in its building process, the full learning diary will be completed by April 2026."

Spatial data analysis and choropleth mapping were produced using ArcGIS Pro, with supporting charts and data visualisations from Excel. A proposal report was also included, outlining actionable solutions of improved cycling infrastructure, car clubs, and travel card schemes to address the Wilmslow’s heavy car dependency and congestion issues.\nView the full report (PDF): Wilmslow Baseline Analysis and Proposal Report\nOther Courseworks\n\nTrafford Local Plan-Making - Transport, Development Management\nPlanning Application for Residential Development at Thornham Old Road, Oldham\nSite Potential Evaluation and Design and Access Statement\nSite Analysis and Local Character and Facilities with Map Making Illustrations\nM3 1FB Context Analyses and Sustainable Development Final Project\nM1 4HD Office Valuation Report\nHousing Market Insights Report of Greater Manchester\nWoodford Aerodrome\nStockport Public Local Planning Enquiry (for CPRE)\nDissertation: Explore the role of vertical greenery systems in enhancing energy efficiency in dense urban areas, strategies for Hong Kong"
