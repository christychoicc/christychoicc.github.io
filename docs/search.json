The analysis applied point pattern analysis methods and spatial autocorrelation methods to identify statistically significant hotspot and coldspot areas, discussing areas to be prioritiesed for policy interventions.\nView the full report (HTML): New York Evictions\n\n\n2.1.1.2 Graffiti San Francisco\nView the full report (HTML): coming soon…\n\n\n2.1.1.3 TfL Vision Zero\nThis is a spatial hotspot analysis examining where deaths and serious injuries cluster across London in 2024 using casualty data provided by TfL. The analysis applied point pattern analysis methods and spatial autocorrelation methods to identify statistically significant hotspot and coldspot areas and discuss policy implications for Vision Zero.\nView the full report (HTML): TfL Vision Zero\n\n\n\n2.1.2 CASA0007 Quantitative Methods\n\n2.1.2.1 House Prices and London Underground: Does Multiple Interchange Tube Stations Link with Higher London House Prices in 2024?\nDo multi-line Tube interchanges relate to higher house prices in London? This report analysed 82k+ property sales in London in 2024 from HM Land Registry Price Paid Data to test whether the connectivity level of the nearest Underground station (single-line vs 2-line vs 3+ line interchange) is associated with sale prices, controlling for property types, distance to central London, distance to nearest Tube station, and deprivation indicies (IMD). The final model explained a substantial variance (R² ≈ 0.527) and found higher prices near multi-line interchanges. Some local neighbourhood effects remain visible in the unexplained part of the model, supported by a positive Moran’s I (≈0.389). A technical appendix is included within the report.\nView the full report (PDF): [London House Prices and Underground Regression Analysis 2024] coming soon…\n\n\n\n2.1.3 CASA0023 Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments\nView my Learning Diary (Webpage): CASA0023 Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments 25/26 Learning Diary\nNote: This webpage is still in its building process, the full learning diary will be complete by April 2026.",

Spatial data analysis and choropleth mapping were produced using ArcGIS Pro, with supporting charts and data visualisations from Excel. A proposal report was also included, outlining actionable solutions of improved cycling infrastructure, car clubs, and travel card schemes to address the Wilmslow’s heavy car dependency and congestion issues.\nView the full report (PDF): Wilmslow Baseline Analysis and Proposal Report",
